# Project Setup

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module replacement. This guide explains how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the project on local machine at `localhost:3000`.

## Prerequisites

- **Git** – for cloning the repository.
- **Node.js** (v16 or later) and **npm** – for managing packages and running scripts.

## Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AshKatale/securefi.git
cd frontend
```

## Installing Dependencies

Install all necessary packages by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server on Port 3000

By default, Vite runs on port `5173`. To run the development server on port `3000`, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using the CLI

Run the development server and specify the port:

```sh
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Option 2: Updating the Vite Config

Modify (or create) the `vite.config.js` file at the root of your project to include a custom server configuration:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    strictPort: true, // Ensures Vite exits if port 3000 is not available
  },
});
```

After starting the server, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Building and Previewing for Production

To build the production version of the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Node.js Installation:** Ensure you have the correct version of Node.js installed.
- **Port Availability:** Verify that port 3000 is free; if not, try stopping the service using it or choose a different port.
- **Reinstalling Modules:** If you run into issues, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
